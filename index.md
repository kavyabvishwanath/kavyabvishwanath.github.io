I am Kavya Vishwanath, currently pursuing my masters in Computer Science at the 
University of Southern California. Prior to this, I worked with Investment management technology division at Goldman Sachs as an Analyst. I got to explore array of things at Goldman functionally and technically. I also actively took part in various community teamworks. I was student mentor for undergarduate students as a part of mentorship program at Goldman Sachs and helped the students to excel in interviews. I was the runner up of Technology Innovation award at Goldman Sachs-Bengaluru, out of 130 projects proposed mine along with 2 other projects were selcted to be implemented.

Apart from academics, I like to travel explore new places and new cusinies :)
